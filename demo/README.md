## Demo

There is no user interface, as this protocol is buried deep inside other DeFi protocols.

To run the tests, in the root folder of the project, open two consoles and run as follows:
- In the first one run ```./anvil.sh```
- In the second one run ```./test.sh```. The test results will appear.
